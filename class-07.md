### What Google Learned From Its Quest to Build the Perfect Team ([Article](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/28/magazine/what-google-learned-from-its-quest-to-build-the-perfect-team.html))

Psychological Safety. I've read this article before, several times in my leadership courses, in my resource management courses. I am familiar with it. The integration of a successful team is not dependent on the qualities of one individual but the entire team. One example I can give of this is in a military training environment. In a room full of leaders, type A personalities, dominate people. The most productive is when all of the people collectively check their ego at the door. 

The most productive meetings, at least the ones I've been in are those where there isn't a leader of the meeting, but a guide. A steward that shepherds the participants through the meeting requirements. The discussion is lively and succinct. We accomplish what is needed and then we can catch up on each others lives.

It may be a product of my training or experience, either way I have a severe distaste for meeting dominator. A dominator in conversation or try to force the meeting. 

I understand that I rant a bit on the topic, but the best meetings are when people do feel safe enough to ask the tough questions and point out the elephant in the room. Or even make a mistake in front of the group and won't have their competency taken into question. Psychological safety is paramount to meeting and team success. Without it a team can be successful, but not everyone will feel accomplished or heard.

### How I explained REST to my brother ([Article](https://gist.github.com/brookr/5977550))

* Who is Roy Fielding?
* Why donâ€™t the techniques that we use today work well when we need to be able to talk to all of the machines in the world?
* What is the HTTP protocol that Fielding and his friends created?
* What does a GET do?
* What does a POST do?
* What does PUT do?
* What does PATCH do?

Roy Fielding is one of the principle authors of the HTTP specification.
The techniques were designed for smaller systems of computers, not the entire computer network of the WWW.
It allows clients to request pages and display them on your computer.
GET: requests information and returns it to the client requestor.
POST: it allows one computer to add information to another
PUT: it allows a computer to update information in its entirety 
PATCH: it allows a computer to update information partially
