### nosql vs sql ([Article](https://www.thegeekstuff.com/2014/01/sql-vs-nosql-db/?utm_source=tuicool))

* Fill in the chart below with five differences between SQL and NoSQL databases:

|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|             SQL                     |               NoSQL                       |
|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| Relational Databases (RDBMS)        |  non-relational or distributed database   |
|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| table based databases               |  document based, key-value pairs, graph   |
|                                     |  databases or wide-column stores.         |
|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| predefined schema                   |  dynamic schema for unstructured data     |
|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| vertically scalable                 |  horizontally scalable                    |
|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|

* What kind of data is a good fit for an SQL database?
* Give a real world example.
* What kind of data is a good fit a NoSQL database?
* Give a real world example.
* Which type of database is best for hierarchical data storage?
* Which type of database is best for scalability?

A SQL datatbase is best utilized with complex query intensive environments
MS-SQL Server Express Edition
A non SQL server is best for hierarchical data
MongoDB
A nonSQL server
A nonSQL for large data sets

* What does SQL stand for?
* What is a realational database?
* What type of structure does a relational database work with?
* What is a ‘schema’?
* What is a NoSQL database?
* How does it work?
* What is inside of a Mongo database?
* Which is more flexible - SQL or MongoDB? and why.
* What is the disadvantage of a NoSQL database?

SQL = Structured Query Language
A relational database relies on relationships between tables, having common identifiers that can be related to each other.
A relational structure works with a table based structure
A nonSQL database is a non relational database structure. it does not rely on relationships but rather collections.
The database is built off documents that look similar to JSON files and those documents are then fed into tha collections. One downside is if you do have a similar field in different documents and collections, you will have to update them all individually. 
MongoDB is more flexible. It is horizontal scalabililty, not restricted by hardware limitations.
NoSQL is schemaless, no relations requiring multiple updates for one item change.
