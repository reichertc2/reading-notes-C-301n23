### Component Based Architecture ([Article](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/software_architecture_design/component_based_architecture.htm))

* What is a component?
* What are the characteristics of a component?
* What are the advantages of using component based architecture?

A component is a part of a  greater whole. It's modular and replaceable portion of the system or machine, or in this case software. In relation to other code it provides specialized functionality and/or behaviors.

A software component typically has three different views:
* Object Oriented
* Conventional
* Process-related

Some of the characteristics of a component are:

* Reusabiltiy
* Replaceable
* Not context specific
* Extensable
* Encapsulated
* Independent

These characteristics play on the modularity of systems. In some redundancy is required for safety reasons, like in aircraft or cars. It also cuts down on costs in both time and resources. Why replace the engine, when you only need to replace the starter. It can also make trouble shooting simpler, yet more time consuming. As individual components can be tested and ruled out or replaced/repaired if found defective.

There are other clear advantages to a component designed system.

* Ease of Deployment
* Reduced cost
* Ease of development
* Reusable
* Modification of technical complexity
* Reliability
* System maintenance and evolution
* Independent

As mentioned above a component (modular) design has quite a few benefits that can be provided in tailored designs of old, just at a portion of the cost. Why reinvent the wheel??

### What is props and How to Use it in React ([Article](https://itnext.io/what-is-props-and-how-to-use-it-in-react-da307f500da0))

* What is props short for?
* How are props used in React?
* What is the flow of props?

Props, or properties are used for passing data between components. They are read only and have a uni-directional flow. If you were to ```console.log(props);``` it would return as an object. A trait that is helpful, especially using dot notation. 

See the article for more examples, as it is a walk through of one.
