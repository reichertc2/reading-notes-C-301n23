### React Lifecycle ([Article](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/software_architecture_design/component_based_architecture.htm))

* Based off the diagram, what happens first, the 'render' or the 'componentDidMount'?
* What is the very first thing to happen in the lifecylce of React?
* Put the following things in the order that they happen:
    * ```componentDidMount```
    * ```render```
    * ```constructor```
    * ```componentWillUnmount```
    * ```React Updates```
* What does componentDidMount do?

In the phasing displayed in the diagram render occurs in the render phase prior t the componentDisMount which occurs after in the commit phase.

In the lifecycle of React the first thing that occurs is the mounting of the components.

The correct order is:
* ```constructor```
* ```render```
* ```React Updates```
* ```componentDidMount```
* ```componentWillUnmount```
