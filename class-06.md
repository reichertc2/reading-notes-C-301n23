### An intro to Node.js on sitepoint.com ([Article](https://www.sitepoint.com/an-introduction-to-node-js/))

* What is node.js?
* In your own words, what is Chrome’s V8 JavaScript Engine?
* What does it mean that node is a JavaScript runtime?
* What is npm?
* What version of node are you running on your machine?
* What version of npm are you running on your machine?
* What command would you type to install a library/package called ‘jshint’?
* What is node used for?

Node.js is an event-based, non-blocking, asychronys I/O.
An open-source engine that serves as the basis for multiple web browsers.
It is a program that can be used to run JavaScript on local machines.
NPM is a package manager for JavaScript within Node.js.
I have node version 14.17.1 running on my machine.
I have npm version 7.24.2 running on my machine.
To install 'jshint' on my machine I would enter the command ```npm install jshint``` or globally ```npm install -g jshint```.

### 6 Reasons for Pair Programming ([Article](https://www.codefellows.org/blog/6-reasons-for-pair-programming/))

* What are the 6 reasons for pair programming?
* In your experience, which of these reasons have you found most beneficial?
* How does pair programming work?

The 6 reasons for pair programming are 
1. Work environment readiness
1. Job interview readiness
1. Social Skills
1. Learning from other students (programmers)
1. Engaged collaboration
1. Greater efficiency

In my experience, the learning from other students has been the key to developing my code language understanding.
Pair programming takes two developers and pairs them to one workstation. The two then work together to accomplish the task/user story. Ont typically handles the workstation manipulation while the other provides real-time feedback and code suggestions.


### Skim Articles
 
 1. ([Geocoding API Docs](https://locationiq.com/docs))
 1. ([Axios Docs](https://www.npmjs.com/package/axios))
 1. ([MDN async and await](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Asynchronous/Async_await))

### Things I want to know more about

* I'd like to learn more about the transfer of information with axios and APIs. This seems pretty interesting
* I'd like to learn more on the capabilities of Node.js.
